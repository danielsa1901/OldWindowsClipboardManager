# OldWindowsClipboardManager
Win+V for older versions of Windows

Requires .NET framework version 2.0 (or newer), should work as far back as Windows 98. Provided a couple of example photos.

Once the program is ran, any text or screenshots saved to the clipboard can be restored, similar to the modern tool. 

Currently works but will be adding improvements later. Not a completely polished program, just made for fun.
